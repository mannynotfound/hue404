# Babel, Express, Starter

This is a starter project for the Babel & Express combo featuring:

  - `async / await` everywhere
  - Designed for ease of unit-testing
  - Service-based folder structure (each folder in `/lib` is a separate service, with its own `index.js`, `datastore.js` [if necessary], and a web `resource.js`) for easier navigation
  - Configuration is done via environment variables that are required via `.env.example` see [dotenv-safe](https://github.com/rolodato/dotenv-safe) for more info.

The `lib/github` service is here to serve as an example of how a service
that has an http resource as well as non-trivial dependencies may be
implemented and tested.

Note: Minimum requirement is Node v4.2.0. Also, this may be a yeoman package in the future.
